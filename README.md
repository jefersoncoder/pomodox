## How Works

- Set the timer to the desired time (usually 25 minutes)
- After the focus period, you will take a short break, (usually 5 minutes)
- the process is repeated for up to 4 times and finally you will have a long break, (usually 15 minutes), resetting the step count and returning to step 0
